# react-native-peldaws
Mobile version of PELDAWS. Developed in React Native. 

Note: React Native projects can be compiled to an iOS or Android app. I don't have an iPhone, so I've only tested this on my OnePlus 5/Nexus 5 (Android).

## Setup

I used [Expo XDE and Expo Client](https://expo.io/tools) when I was developing this app. Download Expo XDE on your Desktop and Expo Client on your phone. While waiting,

```
git clone https://github.com/ignatiusbill/react-native-peldaws.git
cd react-native-peldaws && npm install
```

Once you've downloaded Expo XDE and npm install'd,

- Launch Expo XDE and open `react-native-peldaws` as an existing project.
- After it's loaded, click `Share` on the right corner to show the app's QR code. Scan this with the Expo Client app on your phone.
- To bring up the developer's options, simply shake your phone. You're now ready to start developing.
